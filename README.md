# Geode Indexer

This repository is for the Geode Mod Indexer. \
This is a streamlined way of adding mods to the Geode Index.

## How to add mods
See the [docs page](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/mods/publishing) for more info.

* Create a new issue called "Add/Update an entry"
* Add a direct link to your .geode file
* Add a link to your source code if you are not verified. We require a source code of the mod, for checking if it follow Geode Index guidelines.
