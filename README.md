# Geode Indexer

This repository is for the Geode Mod Indexer. \
This is a streamlined way of adding mods to the Geode Index.

## How to add mods
See the [docs page](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/mods/publishing) for more info.

* Create a new issue called "Add an entry"
* Add a direct link to your .geode file

### If this is your first time adding an entry
We require a source code of the mod, for checking if it follow Geode Index guidelines. After your entry has been verified, you can add new entries. It is expected for you to follow the guidelines for your future entries too, and we will take action when it is needed.
